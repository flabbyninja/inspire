# Web Development Projects to Inspire

## 1. JSON Formatter and Validator

Given a string, validate whether it represents a valid JSON file. If it's not valid, display an error message that explains the problem.

If it's valid, pretty-print the JSON so it's easily parseable by the user.
Let the user copy the result.

## 2. JSON <-> YAML Converter

Given a JSON string, produce the corresponding YAML representation and vice versa.

If the input is not valid, display an error message that explains the problem.

## 3. Meme Generator

Given an image, and a string, generate a new image with the text embedded in it.
Allow users to select from different fonts, sizes, and colours.

Users should be able to download the generated meme.

## 4. Domain Name Generator

Allow users to generate domain names using a seed and a length. The seed should be part of the generated domain.

You can use name.com's API to ensure the domains you generate are unique.

## 5. Markdown-based blog engine

A simple blog engine where posts are stored as markdown files in a folder. The name of the file should represent the URL of the post.

You can also add the date as part of the file name. Landing page + Archive page with pagination.

You can come up with all sorts of fun stuff to display here.

## 7. Image Optimiser / Web Scrapper

Given the URL of a page, list all the images that are being used and allow the user to download an optimised version of each one of them.

For example, allow the user to download all the images converted to WebP.

## 8. Whiteboard

Allow users to freely draw on the screen and download the result as an image.

## 9. Password Generator

Users should be able to specify the number of characters, and whether it should include symbols and the site will generate a password.
